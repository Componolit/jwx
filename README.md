# About

JWX is as library for handling [JSON](https://www.json.org/) data implemented
in the [SPARK](http://spark-2014.org) programming language. Using the SPARK
toolset, the absence of runtime errors can be shown. As a result, JWX is
particularly suited for processing untrusted information.

JWX is **work in progress**. In the future, support for JSON Web Key (JWX, RFC
7517), JSON Web Signature (JWS, RFC 7515), JSON Web Encryption (JWE, RFC 7516),
JSON Web Tokens (JWT, RFC 7519) and potentially [JSON
Schema](http://json-schema.org) is anticipated.
