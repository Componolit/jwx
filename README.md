**JWX is work in progress**.

JWX is a library for handling [JSON](https://www.json.org/) data implemented
in the [SPARK](http://spark-2014.org) programming language. Using the SPARK
toolset, the absence of runtime errors can be shown. As a result, JWX is
particularly suited for processing untrusted information.

In the current version, parsing of Base64 (RFC 4648) data, JSON (RFC 8259)
documents, JSON Web Keys (JWK, RFC 7517) and limited support for JSON Web
Signature (JWS, RFC 7515) is implemented. In the future, JSON Web Encryption
(JWE, RFC 7516), JSON Web Tokens (JWT, RFC 7519) and potentially [JSON
Schema](http://json-schema.org) is anticipated.
